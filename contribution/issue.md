# Finding an Issue To Work On: 3 Easy Steps!
----

## 1. Find an issue that interests you!
Look at some of the [open issues](https://github.com/codebuddies/cb-v2-scratch/issues) and identify one that sparks your interest.
- If you are looking for issues that are good for beginners, check out the issues labeled ["good-for-beginners"](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-for-beginners) or ["good first issue"](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## 2. Claim that issue!
If you want to work on the issue, leave a comment on it saying that you're working on it.

## 3. Create a new branch!
Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b issue-x`, where x is the number associated with that number.  For example, if you decided to work on [issue #491](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues/491), you would type `git checkout -b issue-491` and create a branch named `issue-491`.
